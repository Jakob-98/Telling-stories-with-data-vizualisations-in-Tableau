# Final project - finding truth in statistics - part 1

### Project outline & proposal
For my final project I will be taking a look at common statistical fallacies and exploring them by creating visualizations. These visualizations will hopefully contribute to our insights regarding these fallacies, and allow us to prevent us from applying them in our daily and proffesional lives. The idea of this project has greatly been influenced by the works of [Daniel Kahneman](https://kahneman.socialpsychology.org/), especially his book [thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) which I recommend everyone who is interested in such subjects to read. 

Key statistical fallicies I am to explore are the Simpson's paradox, regression to the mean, availability, the gamblers fallacy, and false causal statistical relationships (due to third variables). 

Lastly, I want to dedicate a section to fallacies in media; often enough one can find themselves looking a skewed bar or pie chart in a political-scented news channel. I want to see how badly the charts respresent the data and what can be improved to decrease the {..} it has on the viewer. 

### Story Arc
The story arc will be introduced with allowing the reader to fall for a statistical fallacy themselves. They will be asked to find a cause for the statistical truth that 'highly intelligent women tend to marry less intelligent men, why?'. Any seasoned statistician should of course realize that this is due to regression to the mean. Hopefully this example will grab the readers' attention. During the middle section of the story, I will go over the other fallacies and explain their implications in real life situations (i.e. Berkeley Lawsuit). Before I convey my departing message, I will show how media often conveys statisitics wrongly, often for the purpose to mislead their audience. I will end up by giving the readers the message that statistics & data are interpretable in various (often wrong) ways, and one might be swayed to use statistics & visualizations in their favour, but to think about the implications that that will bring. 


### Choosing the methodology 
For the purpose of the final project, I will be creating a page using shorthand as a platform. I will use a combination of rawgraphs.io, datawrapper.de and tableau as visualization tools, as well as Adobe Illustrator for possible final touches & other visualizations that I deem neccessary to convey the story.

### Finding datasets:
The datasets I will be using are mostly relevant to show the reader what the implications of statistical fallacies are, and therefore the actual datasets are less relevant than the message that is conveyed by the visualization. I'm exploring different datasets from publications regarding these statistical fallacies since on most of these fallacies, research has extensively been done. 

Disclaimer; the datasets I have shown below are not the final datasets I will be using, since I'm currently still researching the topics and am constantly finding interesting data sources. 

For the availability heuristic I currently plan on scraping the data from [this research paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c2b/6ad0bc7336747c1d39ee4c8a9011cdf3a21f.pdf) titled "How Do People Judge Risks:
Availability Heuristic, Affect Heuristic, or Both?". However, I might choose a different dataset later on. I can use the data from the research to show the impact of the availability heuristic on ones perception of statistics, this will probably be done using a bar graph. 

For the gamblers fallacy I am planning to scrape the data from [this paper](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/croson.pdf), and explore the fallacy further by showcasing the statistics of probably during gambling. This will be done by creating my own dataset. 

For false causal statistical relationships there are many datasets available to get the point across, especially when using the infamous causaution vs correlation example. [This website](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) shows interesting "spurious correlations" with sources, I'm looking into finding a similar relationship on my own but I haven't had success yet. 

A specific dataset for regression to the mean is not relevant, since it will be a vizualisation explaining the effects of correlation. Any dataset with correlation will suffice, and I have not yet decided which dataset will be used.

As for the final section, statistical vizual fallacies in media, I have not chosen the specific data visualizations I will be improving upon, but plenty can be found on the subreddit [dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/)

### Sketches: 
For 3 out of 6 subjects I aim to explore, I have decided how to respresent the data. The sketches below will be an indicator of the final representation. 

First graph Simpson's paradox used to show the difference in acceptance rates:

No source - approximation

Regression to the mean: singling out a single case for explanation:

Example media comparison: 
I would show the original media post and compare it to the improved visualization, and explore the implications the original image has on the interpretation of the image.

Improved the design so that the bar chart is actually on scale:

# Part II: final project
I decided to decrease the scope of the project after thinking about it and initial feedback from my peers. The story now consists of three elements; the regression to the mean example, the Simpsons Paradox and media statistical fallacies. The focus is on the first two, as the final one will be constructed during the finalization of the project website. 

### target audience
The audience that I target with my story are people that are somewhat familiar with data visualizations and 

### in-detail storyboard
I have created the website where I will be presenting the final project. 

Please note that this is just an indicator of the final version of the project, and the data visualizations/sources/text area's are not final (as I will probably be making changes during this&following weeks). The website was used as a storyboard visualisation for my interviewees. 
[storyboard](https://preview.shorthand.com/K0jOnPXPOvScs055)


#### Visualizations
I sketched the four main visualizations for the key two parts of my story. I have not sketched my last part (media) since I will be creating & adding them next week. In the sketches, the information regarding the titles/lables/sources is less relevant to me than the type of visualization, and wether it supports the visualization. These will therefore not be included in the questions for the interviewees. In my final visualization I will add some final touches to source & titles. 

Then visualizations of the first part of my story are almost more of an info-graphic style. This was decided as I felt like this conveyed the message 

I decided to show the difference in acceptance rate using a barchart, and the simpsons paradox by showcasing the correlation between acceptance rate per department and percentage of female applicants. These wireframes will be shown to my interview audience with the key question being; does it support the story? 

There are 3 key takeaways in the story. 
The first being: 
#### False stories are sometimes created by forgetting to think about statistics or data. 

The second key takeaway is: 
#### Data can sometimes give rise to a story which might not be in line with reality. 

The last takeaway is: 
#### When visualizations are used to create a story, one should think about why the creator is trying to tell that story. 

With the final message being: 
#### Stories, data and visualizations do not always allign or create a picture of reality. In the end, you are responsible for thinking for yourself and creating that picture of reality.  


Story: 
'''Today were going to look at 3 different way data and their interpreted stories do not allign; lets start with a question; 


PART 1) 
Highly intelligent women tend to mary men who are less intelligent than they are.

why?

Daniel kahneman, nobel prize winner in economics claims this not to be a causal relationship but one of pure statistics. Lets take a look at why this might be. 

Youre at a bar, and youre an exceptionally smart individual. You are a statistical outlier. You see someone else at the bar who looks interesting. At this moment you're not comparing your IQ's, you just want to have good fun. Here regression to the mean comes to play; you're an outlier, the chances he is a higher outlier is lower than. This is a biased approach to this 'problem'
PART 2) 
As we have seen, we sometimes try to create a story before thinking about or data statistics, and this can be dangerous as we have just seen. But what if we take a look where statistics create the story which is wrong? 

PART 3)

Stories can be wrong. Statistics can be wrong. Keep thinking critically. If youre interested in more of this read kahnemans book.'''




## user-research protocol
The .. key aspects I will try to unveil during the interviews are
	Do the examples in the story fit the story? 
	Do the visualizations add value to the story?
	What might be confusing about the visualizations?
	What would you have done differently in these visualisations? 
	Do you feel like there is a clear message at the end of the story? 
	

## questions 
I will begin my 


//what part of the graphics were confusing to you? 

//If you were to retell this story, what would you change? 
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

## individual interview 1
Exploratory interview; does the current story make sense? 
Ricardo, a MISM student & friend: 
//I'm going to tell you a story which is supported by visualizations, could you tell me how and in what these graphics help underline the story?

Part 1a/1b/1c. Looks good, I like it.  -> you want to include the source of this data. Also put a note in the assumptions. Youre making a huge assumption. 

Do you think it supports the story. 

2a: what is the acceptance rate? -> unclear what this means. There should be a note saying what this means. 
What is 1973? (its the year). It should be more clear that it is from one year. 

I dont like the visualization  because basically the regerssion has a lot of noise and I cannot conclude something because of the high variance. The significance is too low to conclude something. The viz does not support my conclusion. MAybe you should consider showing the variance in the mean of acceptance rate. 
TMI if I add the values of the specific sectors.
