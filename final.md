# Final project - finding truth in statistics

### Project outline & proposal
For my final project I will be taking a look at common statistical fallacies, something which humans have a tendency to, and exploring them by creating visualizations. These visualizations will hopefully contribute to our insights regarding these fallacies, and allow us to prevent us from applying them in our daily and proffesional lives. The idea of this project has greatly been influenced by the works of [Daniel Kahneman](https://kahneman.socialpsychology.org/), especially his book [thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) which I recommend everyone who is interested in such subjects to read. 

I will explore the statistical fallacies often made 

Lastly, I want to dedicate a section to fallacies made on purpose; often enough one can find themselves looking a skewed bar or pie chart in a political-scented news channel. I want to see how badly the charts respresent the data and what can be improved to decrease the {..} it has on the viewer. 

### Choosing the methodology 
For the purpose of the final project, I will be creating a page using {..} as a platform. 

### Finding datasets
