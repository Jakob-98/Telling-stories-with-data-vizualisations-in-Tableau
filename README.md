# cmustudent-portfolio 
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stores with Data class at CMU!

### About me
My name is Jakob Serlier, I'm an exchange student from Delft University of Technology, and I'm currently a Systems Engineering, Policy & Management student in the IT track. I also follow an honorary degree in IT related subjects. 

### What I hope to learn and do
I hope to get a better understanding of how to use data visualizations in a professional environment, and I hope to improve my ability to convey idea's using these vizualizations. Communication is key in every aspect of your professional life, and hopefully this course will help me improve my communication skills in this area. Lastly, I hope to be able to show off my portfolio on my personal website, https:jakobs.dev, which I haven't really had the chance to update yet.
