# Final project

### Project outline
For my final project I will be taking a look at common statistical fallacies, something which humans have a tendency to, and exploring them by creating visualizations. These visualizations will hopefully contribute to our insights regarding these fallacies, and allow us to prevent us from applying them in our daily and proffesional lives. The idea of this project has greatly been influenced by the works of [Daniel Kahneman](https://kahneman.socialpsychology.org/), especially his book [thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) which I recommend everyone who is interested in such subjects to read.
