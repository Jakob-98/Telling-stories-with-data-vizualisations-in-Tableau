# Final project - finding truth in statistics - part 1

### Project outline & proposal
For my final project I will be taking a look at common statistical fallacies and exploring them by creating visualizations. These visualizations will hopefully contribute to our insights regarding these fallacies, and allow us to prevent us from applying them in our daily and proffesional lives. The idea of this project has greatly been influenced by the works of [Daniel Kahneman](https://kahneman.socialpsychology.org/), especially his book [thinking fast and slow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinking,_Fast_and_Slow) which I recommend everyone who is interested in such subjects to read. 

Key statistical fallicies I am to explore are the Simpson's paradox, regression to the mean, availability, the gamblers fallacy, and false causal statistical relationships (due to third variables). 

Lastly, I want to dedicate a section to fallacies in media; often enough one can find themselves looking a skewed bar or pie chart in a political-scented news channel. I want to see how badly the charts respresent the data and what can be improved to decrease the {..} it has on the viewer. 

### Story Arc
The story arc will be introduced with allowing the reader to fall for a statistical fallacy themselves. They will be asked to find a cause for the statistical truth that 'highly intelligent women tend to marry less intelligent men, why?'. Any seasoned statistician should of course realize that this is due to regression to the mean. Hopefully this example will grab the readers' attention. During the middle section of the story, I will go over the other fallacies and explain their implications in real life situations (i.e. Berkeley Lawsuit). Before I convey my departing message, I will show how media often conveys statisitics wrongly, often for the purpose to mislead their audience. I will end up by giving the readers the message that statistics & data are interpretable in various (often wrong) ways, and one might be swayed to use statistics & visualizations in their favour, but to think about the implications that that will bring. 


### Choosing the methodology 
For the purpose of the final project, I will be creating a page using shorthand as a platform. I will use a combination of rawgraphs.io, datawrapper.de and tableau as visualization tools, as well as Adobe Illustrator for possible final touches & other visualizations that I deem neccessary to convey the story.

### Finding datasets:
The datasets I will be using are mostly relevant to show the reader what the implications of statistical fallacies are, and therefore the actual datasets are less relevant than the message that is conveyed by the visualization. I'm exploring different datasets from publications regarding these statistical fallacies since on most of these fallacies, research has extensively been done. 

Disclaimer; the datasets I have shown below are not the final datasets I will be using, since I'm currently still researching the topics and am constantly finding interesting data sources. 

For the availability heuristic I currently plan on scraping the data from [this research paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1c2b/6ad0bc7336747c1d39ee4c8a9011cdf3a21f.pdf) titled "How Do People Judge Risks:
Availability Heuristic, Affect Heuristic, or Both?". However, I might choose a different dataset later on. I can use the data from the research to show the impact of the availability heuristic on ones perception of statistics, this will probably be done using a bar graph. 

For the gamblers fallacy I am planning to scrape the data from [this paper](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/157/Papers/croson.pdf), and explore the fallacy further by showcasing the statistics of probably during gambling. This will be done by creating my own dataset. 

For false causal statistical relationships there are many datasets available to get the point across, especially when using the infamous causaution vs correlation example. [This website](https://www.tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations) shows interesting "spurious correlations" with sources, I'm looking into finding a similar relationship on my own but I haven't had success yet. 

A specific dataset for regression to the mean is not relevant, since it will be a vizualisation explaining the effects of correlation. Any dataset with correlation will suffice, and I have not yet decided which dataset will be used.

As for the final section, statistical vizual fallacies in media, I have not chosen the specific data visualizations I will be improving upon, but plenty can be found on the subreddit [dataisugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/)

### Sketches: 
For 3 out of 6 subjects I aim to explore, I have decided how to respresent the data. The sketches below will be an indicator of the final representation.

Example media comparison: 
I would show the original media post and compare it to the improved visualization, and explore the implications the original image has on the interpretation of the image.

Improved the design so that the bar chart is actually on scale: 
<iframe title="Sonntagsfrage nationalratswahl 2019 (%)" aria-label="Column Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-BbmQP" src="//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/BbmQP/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="219"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}})}();</script>
