# Jakob Serlier - portfolio 
This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stores with Data class at CMU!

## [The final project can be found here](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/serlier/index.html)

### About me
My name is Jakob Serlier, I'm an exchange student from Delft University of Technology, and I'm currently a Systems Engineering, Policy & Management student in the IT track. I also follow an honorary degree in IT related subjects. Most of my professional experience can be found on my [LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/serlier/), which I encourage you to check out! 

### ~~What I hope to learn and do~~ What I have learned and done: 
I hope to get a better understanding of how to use data visualizations in a professional environment, and I hope to improve my ability to convey idea's using these vizualizations. Communication is key in every aspect of your professional life, and hopefully this course will help me improve my communication skills in this area. Lastly, I hope to be able to show off my portfolio on my personal website, https://jakobs.dev, which I haven't really had the chance to make a proper CV out of yet. 

Lastly I hope to have a bit of fun. Usually I'm the type to avoid 'creative' subjects, however, I noticed that I tend to enjoy being creative a lot; this course seems like a good mix of creativty and 'serious' subject matter, and I'm excited to get started with it!

### Behind the scenes look regarding the final Project, Finding truth in statistics: 
[Project: Behind the scences](final.md)

*Summary:*
In the fall of 1973, the UC Berkeley admittance rates between sexes were significantly different. The question arose whether or not this is a case of gender bias, discrimination, or if this is caused by other factors. It turns out the aggregated data tells a different story from the non-aggregated data. This was a case of the Simpson’s Paradox, as it turned out women tended to apply to departments which were diffcult to get into, more often. The admittance rates were quite similiar if looked at on a per-department basis. This shows that statistics and data can’t always be trusted. Call to action: “There are three type of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics” -Mark Twain. Think critically.

### OECD data visualization
[Click here to go to the OECD visualizations page](OECD.md)

This page contains different visualization of the same dataset; https://data.oecd.org/gga/general-government-debt.htm. The visualizations were made with datawrapper.de, Tableau and rawgraphs.io
The dataset shows the general government debt in % of GDP of various countries during a period of around 20 years. The first bar chart shown is a chart made avaiable by the Economic co-operation and Development organization. Further visualizations are of my own work, these include an (improved) bar chart, a beeswarm plot, a boxplot, an areagraph and lastly, a heatmap. The beeswarm plot and areagraph are quite similar, they use nearly the same method to display data, and are very similar in axes and setup, apart from the fact that the beeswarm plot uses distinct ‘bubbles’ per year, whereas the area plot uses a gradual transition. The last visualization is wonderful for gaining much insight about the data when one has the chance to take their time to look at the data, but also instinctively see the trend in the data by just glancing at it for a moment. I was interested in showing the change of debt to %GDP, so I chose to euse a boxplot to do that, which gives an interesting view on the datarange of the various countries’ debts. Enjoy looking around!

### Critique by design
[Click here to see the critique by design part of my portfolio](critiquebydesign.md)

In This following part of the portfolio, I have giving critique on a comically bad visualization by the New York Times in their article from 09/18/2019 about Why the Fed Lowered Interest Rates Again. The visualization is one that tries to show the reader everything and conveys nothing. This is an iterative process in which I will conduct audience research to improve my visualization.
