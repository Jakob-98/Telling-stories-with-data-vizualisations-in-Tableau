### Critique by design
In the following part of the portfolio, I will be giving critique on a comically bad visualization by the New York Times in their article from 09/18/2019 about [Why the Fed Lowered Interest Rates Again](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/09/18/business/economy/fed-second-rate-cut.html). The visualization is one that tries to show the reader everything and conveys nothing. It is a futile attempt to support the text in a meaningful and somewhat 'interesting to the eye' manner, but it failed to impress.<br><br>

## Personal critique
My main point of critique on was that the chart wanted to show too much, but said very little about the data we are actually interested in; 

## gathering the data
In order to recreate this chart I used [this](https://countryeconomy.com/key-rates) website to scrape the relevant data for the key central bank rates. The data scraped corresponded correctly. After some fiddling around in excel I was able to create a datasheet which was parseable by Tableau. The next step was to make a draft of my visualization. 

## External critique
I spoke to two peers about my work, both have analytical backgrounds but no real data viz. backgrounds, which I think helped me to get an intere

## Final visualization
I'm happy with the result. One can see the recent changes and trends in central bank rates with just a quick glance, there is little cluttler to (..). There are a few things I'm not 100% happy with yet, however. I wasn't able to find a way to **bold** the America line and title (something which I will ask next lecture). Another thing I'm unsure about is the date; I wanted to keep the X axis fairly free from data clutter, but maybe I shouldve added a little more detailed date indicators. Overall the result is much better fitting for the story which the original article wanted to convey. Still, I felt like NYT fitted the data to what they wanted people to see, instead what the data might actually represent..
